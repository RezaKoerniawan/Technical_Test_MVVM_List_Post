# Technical_Test_MVVM_List_Post

This is a sample Android application developed in Java, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. The project utilizes ViewBinding for efficient and type-safe access to UI components, reducing the need for findViewById.

The app integrates with the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free online REST service, to fetch and display sample data such as posts, users, or comments. It demonstrates proper handling of network requests, data binding, and lifecycle-aware components in a clean, modular structure.

Key Features:

Written in Java for compatibility and clarity.

MVVM architecture ensures separation of concerns and testability.

ViewBinding simplifies UI interactions with type-safe references.

Retrofit used for REST API communication.

Displays data from JSONPlaceholder (e.g., list of posts or users).

Uses LiveData and ViewModel for reactive data handling.

This project serves as a basic template or learning tool for developers looking to understand modern Android app structure with Java.
